The Tye extension makes it easier to run and debug applications that are using [Tye](https://github.com/dotnet/tye)

## Prerequisites

### Docker

Using Tye requires Docker to be installed.\
[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your machine and add it to the system path.

### Tye

Using the Tye tooling requires a project to be run using the Tye CLI.\
Instructions for installing Tye CLI can be found [here](https://github.com/dotnet/tye/blob/main/docs/getting_started.md).

### Visual Studio Code
[Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and install Visual Studio Code on your machine.

## Feature Overview
The Tye extension lets you view and debug Tye services.

### View running Tye application
You can view the running Tye application, view all services and it's replicas, view logs and open the services in the browser.

### Generating Tye assets
You can add `tye.yaml` file to your workspace by opening the Command Palette (<kbd>F1</kbd>) and using **Tye: Initialize Tye** command. The command will generate `tye.yaml` based on .NET projects in the solution currently open in the workspace.

### Generating task and launch configuration
You can add the task **tye-run** to run the Tye application and a debug launch configuration **Debug with Tye** to debug the Tye application by opening the Command Palette (<kbd>F1</kbd>) and using the **Tye: Scaffold Tye Tasks** command.

### Running and debugging the Tye application
The extension offers command to run the Tye application, attach the debugger to already running service or start the Tye application with debugger attached to all debuggable services.

#### Run the Tye application
You can run the Tye application by running the task **tye-run**.

#### Debug an already running service
You can attach the debugger to an already running service by clicking on the **Attach** icon on any replica of the service you want to debug.

#### Debug with Tye
The **Debug with Tye** launch configuration helps you debug multiple services at a time.
The default scaffolded configuration attaches the debugger to all debuggable services, but it can be configured to attach to only a subset of services.

##### Configuring a subset of services to debug
Services to debug can be configured by adding `services` property in the **Debug with Tye** launch configuration.

##### Enabling the `watch` mode for debugging
The Tye extension lets you start the Tye application in the `watch` mode and subsequently attach the debugger in the `watch` mode. With the `watch` mode on, the debugger watches for any code changes and re-attaches to the re-spawned services.
